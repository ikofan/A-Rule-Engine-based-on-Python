# A-Rule-Engine-based-on-Python
A Rule Engine made by myself using python. Which explain the rules wrote in TXT file, and accept the fact situation in dictionary format, finally output another dictionary contains the reasoning result.

Attentionï¼š the fact dictionary you input need to be matched the rules'condition you wrote ,or you will get a null result.

INPUT: dict(fact)
OUTPUT: dict(result)
the engine explain the rules you wrote in a certain format in TXT and record the data as a rule table.
when you throw a fact dictionary to it , it will work like a pipeline , and output another dictionary which may have some data you interested in.
